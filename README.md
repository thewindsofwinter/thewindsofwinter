# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy, lifelong learner and high school junior at the [Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy](https://imsa.edu). I use GitHub to store small projects of mine that I code in my free time, and I'm also looking to get into open source a lot more!

# :computer: Skillset [WIP]

- :coffee: Java: my first language which I've done lots of work in
- :snake: Python: a language that I'm getting into more for the purposes of Machine Learning and Articifical Intelligence
- :man_technologist: JavaScript (and Node and React): getting more into this language for web development, most familiar with Node
