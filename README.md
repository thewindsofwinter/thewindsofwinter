Hiya - I'm Andy, a sophomore at Stanford. This summer, I'm working on aligning diffusion-based [protein-ligand docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecular_docking) with physics using [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulations at [Genesis Therapeutics](https://genesistherapeutics.ai/). Previously, I've also served as president of [Stanford Student Robotics](https://stanfordstudentrobotics.org/), organized [TreeHacks](https://treehacks.com/), interned at [Quilter](https://www.quilter.ai/), [Replit](https://replit.com/~) and [Cloudflare Magic Transit](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/), and published research on particle physics (at [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/)) and epilepsy (at the [UIUC Chung Lab](https://app.mcb.illinois.edu/chunghj/lab-members/)).

My primary interest is how to align machine learning methods with complex ``physical" truth: think things like math, coding, circuit design, drug discovery, and robot learning. I believe the architectural and data-gathering techniques developed in these disciplines will pave the way for reliable machine learning and general, safe artificial intelligence. I'm especially interested in uncertainty quantification, autonomous data collection, generative models, and fine-tuning on simulation data, topics which I'm exploring as an undergraduate robotics researcher at [Stanford AI Lab (IRIS)](https://irislab.stanford.edu/) under the guidance of [Annie Chen](https://anniesch.github.io/).
