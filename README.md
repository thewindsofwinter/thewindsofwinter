# Hi there! 👋

I'm Andy, a lifelong learner and rising college freshman at Stanford University. I'm especially interested in the software frameworks that will power the technology of the future, with experience on [Cloudflare Magic Transit](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/) as a software engineering intern and the [UIUC Chung Lab](https://app.mcb.illinois.edu/chunghj/lab-members/) as a student researcher, among other projects. My GitHub is mostly used to store small projects that I've built in my free time. Feel free to shoot me crazy project ideas: if I can help out, I will <3
