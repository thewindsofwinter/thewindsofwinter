Hiya - I'm Andy, a senior at Stanford working in [Stanford AI Lab (IRIS)](https://irislab.stanford.edu/) at SAIL. My primary interest is in understanding and improving agents to solve difficult, long-horizon tasks reliably. I also build fun robots with [Stanford Student Robotics](https://stanfordstudentrobotics.org/), where I was previously president.

Currently @ [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) AI infrastructure over the summer. Previously ML [protein-ligand docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecular_docking) at [Genesis Therapeutics](https://genesistherapeutics.ai/), circuit board optimization at [Quilter](https://www.quilter.ai/), code deployments at [Replit](https://replit.com/~), L3 DDoS protection at [Cloudflare Magic Transit](https://www.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/). 

Want to build / chat? Shoot me an email [andyyt2] at [stanford]
